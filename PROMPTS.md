### Key Prompts Used

1. **Initial Setup**
   > “Optional Assignment Instructions: build an AI-powered app on Cloudflare. Include LLM, Workflow, Pages, and state. Help me scaffold it.”

3. **Durable Object Binding Fix**
   > “I get error ‘Your Worker depends on Durable Objects not exported’. Help me export and migrate properly.”

4. **Workflows Integration**
   > “Give full code example for ChatWorkflow that uses Llama 3.3 and stores results in a Durable Object.”

5. **CORS Preflight Issue**
   > “Access to fetch at /chat blocked by CORS — fix preflight and show correct placement of handler.”

6. **Final Project Prep**
   > “Create final worker.ts with LLM, Workflows, Durable Object, CORS, and deployment-ready code.”

7. **README + Submission**
   > “Generate full README for Cloudflare AI Assignment with repo naming rules and running instructions.”

### AI Contribution Summary
AI was used **only for boilerplate, debugging, and documentation generation**.  
All architectural decisions, integrations, and final implementation logic were verified and tested manually by me.
